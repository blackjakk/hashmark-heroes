## TL;DR — the reframing

The instinct was "if we want more in-game features + multiplayer, we probably
need an in-game clock." Grounding the code flips the conclusion:

- **We already have a clock.** The audited engine (`class GameSimulator`,
  `play-engine.js:350`) is a genuine play-by-play simulator: quarters, a game
  clock (`this.time`, 900s/quarter), drives, downs, distance, field position,
  score-over-time, OT — and **situational AI already woven in** (4th-down
  decisions, tempo by score+time, late/desperate modes). It even has a
  **serializable state snapshot/restore** primitive (~`:2412`).
- **`frnSimOnce` throws the timeline away.** It constructs the sim, runs a full
  game, then persists only the **final box score** (`g.stats` via
  `_stripGameStatsForStorage`, `play-franchise-offseason.js:1889`). The rich
  in-game timeline is computed and discarded every game.

So the real work is **not** "build a clock." It's three **orthogonal**
workstreams, only the last of which is large:

| Workstream | Unlocks | Size |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Persist & expose game-state** | phase-accurate blowout rest, situational/clutch & garbage-time stats, watch-the-game, replays | small–medium |
| **B. Determinism (seed the RNG)** | reproducible games, replays, **and any multiplayer at all** | medium |
| **C. Externalize playcalling + netcode** | **live H2H playcalling**, interactive in-game decisions | large |

And the crucial reframing for multiplayer specifically: **the blocker is
determinism + an authority model, not the clock.** You can ship rich *async*
league multiplayer with the clock fully internal. The clock matters for
*experience and interactivity*, which is exactly what live H2H needs.

## North star: live head-to-head playcalling

Two human GMs, each calling plays for their team in real time (or
play-by-play turn-based), against a shared authoritative game state. This is
the most demanding target on every axis:

- It needs the engine to **pause at each playcall**, accept an **external**
  call (human, over the network) instead of the internal AI, resolve the play,
  and continue.
- It needs **determinism** so both clients agree on every outcome (or a server
  is the single source of truth).
- It needs **netcode**: authority, latency handling, a play-clock with an
  AI-fallback on timeout, and reconnection.

Everything below is sequenced so each phase is independently valuable and the
audited engine (`AUDIT.md` bands) is never destabilized.

---

## What exists today (grounded)

- **`class GameSimulator`** — `play-engine.js:350`. Constructor seeds state:
  `this.score={home,away}`, `this.quarter=1`, `this.time=900`, `this.yardLine=25`,
  `this.down=1`, `this.ytg=10`, `this.poss` (`:494–520`).
- **Real game loop** — `while (this.quarter <= 4)` (`:7007`); drive loop
  `while (this.time > 0 && plays < 22)` (`:6707`); OT loop (`:7094`). Clock
  burns `this.time -= 10` per play (`:2507`).
- **Situational AI already inline** — end-of-half "go for points" (`:1133`),
  tempo `heavy`/`mild` by score diff + time (`:1206`), passing-down detection
  (`:2247`), late-game / desperate modes (`:2239`, `:2721`). This is the brain
  that must become *pluggable* for H2H.
- **State snapshot/restore** — `~:2412` restores `yardLine/down/ytg/time/
  quarter/poss/score` from an object `s`. A serializable `GameState` already
  effectively exists; it just isn't named, persisted, or exposed.
- **Per-snap resolution** — `_pickTrenchRep`, `_coverName`, `_trench`/
  `_battleScore` (see `MFF.md`). The engine resolves specific player matchups
  every play; MFF added attribution as a **logging layer**, not engine surgery.
- **Persistence** — `frnSimOnce` (`play-franchise-offseason.js:1682`) →
  `new GameSimulator(...)` → keeps only `g.stats` (box score).
- **Audit gate** — `_audit_all.sh`, `_sim_audit.js`, NFL reference bands in
  `AUDIT.md`. Realism is regression-proofed; engine changes are validated
  against the bands (byte-identical for refactors, behaviorally for intended
  changes — the `MFF.md` discipline).
- **RNG gap** — **215** `Math.random()` calls in `play-engine.js` (142) +
  `play-player.js` (73), plus ~334 in the franchise layer. **Zero seeding.**
  The sim is fully non-deterministic today.

## Workstream A — Persist & expose game-state

> **Status: largely shipped.** Discovery found the sim *already* persists a
> scoring timeline per game (`g.scoring`: cumulative `{qtr, homeScore, awayScore,
> isScore}`) plus `g.momentumLog`, and the box score already derives quarter
> scores + a scoring summary from it. The remaining gap — a **gameplay** consumer
> of the timeline — is now closed: **phase-accurate Blowout Rest** (below) reads
> the timeline via the new `_gameRestFraction` accessor (`play-franchise-core.js`)
> and scales the rest benefit by how much of the game was garbage time. A margin
> fallback preserves behavior on legacy/quick-sim games with no timeline.

**Goal:** make the timeline a first-class, serializable artifact instead of an
ephemeral local.

1. Name the snapshot the engine already restores into a **`GameState`** schema:
   `{ quarter, time, down, ytg, yardLine, poss, score, seed, playIndex }`.
2. Have `GameSimulator` emit a **lightweight event stream** as it runs — at
   minimum drive boundaries + scoring + the WP we already chart, ideally one
   compact record per play. Store a downsampled timeline on the game
   (`g.timeline`) alongside `g.stats`; keep it small (drives, not every snap)
   to stay save-size-friendly.
3. Expose **derived queries**: "score/WP at quarter Q", "when did margin first
   exceed N", "snaps by player by quarter".

**Unlocks:**
- **Phase-accurate Blowout Rest** ✅ — reads the persisted `g.scoring` timeline
  (via `_gameRestFraction`) to know *when* the game was in hand. A wire-to-wire
  blowout protects starters far more (injury mul ~0.30, deep wear shed) than a
  late pull-away at the same final margin (~0.71, little shed). The margin
  threshold still gates *whether* rest happens; the timeline scales *how much*.
- **Situational stats** — clutch (4th-quarter close), garbage-time splits,
  comeback tracking — the same `g.scoring` walk powers these next.
- **Watch-the-game / replay** — already present (`replayClips`, quarter scores,
  scoring summary, momentum/WP); a drive-by-drive recap can build on it.

Risk: **low.** No engine-math changes; this is logging + a schema. Gate-safe by
construction (final box score unchanged → `AUDIT.md` bands unaffected).

---

## Workstream B — Determinism (the multiplayer prerequisite)

**Goal:** `(seed + inputs) → byte-identical game`, everywhere it matters.

1. Add a small seeded PRNG (e.g. `mulberry32`/`xorshift128`) as an engine
   instance field: `this.rng`. Store the **per-game seed** on `GameState`.
2. Replace `Math.random()` **in the sim path first** (`play-engine.js`,
   `play-player.js`) with `this.rng()`. The franchise-layer 334 calls (draft,
   FA, dev) can migrate later or stay non-deterministic where they don't affect
   live games.
3. Seed from current entropy by default → **no gameplay change, no audit
   drift** (validate with `_audit_all.sh`: the distributions must match the
   pre-change bands).
4. Decide the **authority model**:
   - *Async league:* server (or designated host) sims with a seed; results
     shipped. Clients can re-verify by replaying the seed.
   - *Live H2H:* **server-authoritative** is the safe default (one truth, no
     desync, natural anti-cheat). Deterministic client lockstep is possible but
     brittle across JS engines/float edge cases — not worth it here.

Why this is the real multiplayer unlock: with 215+ unseeded calls, no two
machines can agree on a game. Determinism also buys **replays and debuggable
sims** for free — independently valuable even if multiplayer slips.

Risk: **medium.** Mechanical but broad; the audit harness is the safety net
(re-run, confirm bands hold). Touches the audited engine, so do it as a pure
refactor (seeded-but-statistically-identical), validated byte-for-byte where
possible and behaviorally against `AUDIT.md` otherwise.

## Workstream C — Externalize playcalling + netcode (the H2H core)

Today the playcall brain is **inline** in the engine (tempo, 4th-down, run/pass
tendencies computed mid-loop). For H2H it must become an **interface**:

1. **Extract a `Coordinator` seam.** At each offensive/defensive decision the
   engine asks a coordinator for a `PlayCall` instead of deciding inline:
   ```
   interface Coordinator { call(gameState, context) -> PlayCall }
   ```
   - `AICoordinator` wraps the *existing* inline logic (zero behavior change —
     validate against the bands).
   - `HumanCoordinator` resolves the call from UI input.
   - `RemoteCoordinator` resolves it from the network (authoritative server).
   This is the highest-value refactor: it makes the engine **drivable** without
   changing what the AI does.
2. **Make the loop yieldable.** The drive/quarter loops must be able to *pause*
   at a decision point and resume with an injected call (generator/async, or an
   explicit step-function `advanceToNextDecision()`), so a human/network can
   answer. The existing snapshot/restore (~`:2412`) is the resume substrate.
3. **Netcode (live H2H):**
   - **Server-authoritative**: server holds `GameState`, runs the engine, both
     clients send `PlayCall`s and receive resolved deltas + timeline events.
   - **Play clock + AI fallback**: each side has N seconds to call; on timeout
     the `AICoordinator` calls for them (graceful, prevents stalls/grief).
   - **Latency/UX**: pre-snap call submission (both submit, server resolves),
     optimistic animation, snap-clock countdown.
   - **Reconnection**: rejoin from the authoritative `GameState` snapshot.
   - **Anti-cheat**: server authority means clients never compute outcomes;
     they only submit intent.

Risk: **large.** This is the real project. But note it builds *on top of* an
already-calibrated engine — the hard simulation problem is solved; this is
control-flow refactor + transport + UX.

## Protecting the audit gate (non-negotiable)

Every change here that touches `play-engine.js` / `play-player.js` must hold the
`AUDIT.md` bands:

- **Refactors (A's logging, B's seeding, C's coordinator extraction)** are
  *intended to be behavior-preserving* → validate with `_audit_all.sh` and aim
  for statistically identical output (ideally byte-identical with a fixed seed).
- **Intentional behavior changes** (e.g. interactive playcalling that lets a
  human deviate from the AI) → validate **behaviorally**, not byte-identically,
  exactly as `MFF.md` did for the analytics coaching AI (Slice G).
- Keep the **GATE-SAFE discipline**: franchise-layer state (morale, rest
  policy, etc.) feeds *triggers and modifiers around* the engine, never the
  audited per-play math.

---

## Phased roadmap (low-regret order)

- **Phase 0 — Blowout Rest (final-margin).** ✅ Shipped (§7). Proves the
  policy + payoff; survives the migration.
- **Phase 1 — Workstream A.** ✅ Timeline already persisted (`g.scoring`);
  phase-accurate Blowout Rest now reads it via `_gameRestFraction`. Remaining:
  clutch / garbage-time stat splits + a drive-by-drive recap (same timeline walk).
- **Phase 2 — Workstream B.** Seed the engine RNG; store per-game seed; lock in
  replays. Decide authority = server-authoritative.
- **Phase 3 — Workstream C.1/C.2.** Extract the `Coordinator` seam + make the
  loop yieldable. Ship **single-player interactive playcalling** first (you vs
  the AICoordinator) — fun on its own and de-risks the seam before networking.
- **Phase 4 — Workstream C.3.** Server-authoritative netcode → **live H2H
  playcalling**, play clock + AI fallback, reconnection.
- **Phase 5 — Polish.** Full play-by-play timeline, live-watch experience,
  spectating, async-league mode reusing the same determinism + authority.

## Data model sketch

```
GameState {            // serializable; the engine already restores this shape
  seed, playIndex,
  quarter, time, down, ytg, yardLine, poss,
  score: { home, away },
}

PlayCall {             // what a Coordinator returns
  side: "off" | "def",
  concept,             // run/pass family, formation, blitz, coverage, tempo...
  personnel, target?,  // engine-meaningful knobs
}

Coordinator {          // the H2H seam
  call(gameState, context): PlayCall
}
// AICoordinator (wraps today's inline logic), HumanCoordinator, RemoteCoordinator

TimelineEvent {        // downsampled, stored on g.timeline
  t, quarter, type,    // "drive_end" | "score" | "turnover" | "play"
  scoreAfter, wp,      // WP we already compute for charts
}
```

## Risks & open questions

- **Save size.** A full play-by-play timeline per game × a season × many seasons
  is heavy. Mitigation: store **drive-level** by default, regenerate
  play-by-play on demand from `(seed + inputs)` once deterministic.
- **Float/JS determinism across clients.** Avoided by choosing
  **server-authoritative** rather than client lockstep.
- **AI parity in H2H.** A human deviating from the calibrated AI can drift the
  *game's* realism (not the engine's) — acceptable, but awards/stats earned in
  H2H may want a flag.
- **Scope of B.** Do we seed only the live-game path, or the whole franchise
  (draft/FA/dev) for fully reproducible saves? Start with the game path.
- **Pacing of H2H.** Real-time snap clock vs. turn-based play-by-play — a
  product call that shapes the netcode and UX.
